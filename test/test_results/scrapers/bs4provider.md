The components of a GPU.
A
graphics processing unit
(
GPU
) is a specialized
electronic circuit
designed for
digital image processing
and to accelerate
computer graphics
, being present either as a component on a discrete
graphics card
or embedded on
motherboards
,
mobile phones
,
personal computers
,
workstations
, and
game consoles
. GPUs are also increasingly being used for
artificial intelligence
(AI) processing due to linear algebra acceleration, which is also used extensively in graphics processing.
Although there is no single definition of the term, and it may be used to describe any video display system, in modern use a GPU includes the ability to internally perform the calculations needed for various graphics tasks, like rotating and scaling 3D images, and often the additional ability to run custom programs known as
shaders
. This contrasts with earlier graphics controllers known as
video display controllers
which had no internal calculation capabilities, or
blitters
, which performed only basic memory movement operations. The modern GPU emerged during the 1990s, adding the ability to perform operations like drawing lines and text without
CPU
help, and later adding 3D functionality.
Graphics functions are generally independent and this lends these tasks to being implemented on separate calculation engines. Modern GPUs include hundreds, or thousands, of calculation units. This made them useful for non-graphic calculations involving
embarrassingly parallel
problems due to their
parallel structure
. The ability of GPUs to rapidly perform vast numbers of calculations has led to their adoption in diverse fields including
artificial intelligence
(AI) where they excel at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks. Other non-graphical uses include the training of
neural networks
and
cryptocurrency mining
.

Intel
,
Nvidia
, and
AMD
/
ATI
were the market share leaders, with 49.4%, 27.8%, and 20.6% market share respectively. In addition,
Matrox
[

while originally producing custom solutions, now customizes GPUs from Intel and AMD for workstation usage. Chinese companies such as
Jingjia Micro
have also produced GPUs for the domestic market although in terms of worldwide sales, they lag behind market leaders.

Computational functions
[

The ATI HD5470 GPU (above, with copper
heatpipe
attached) features
UVD
2.1 which enables it to decode AVC and VC-1 video formats.
Several factors of GPU construction affect the performance of the card for real-time rendering, such as the size of the connector pathways in the
semiconductor device fabrication
, the
clock signal
frequency, and the number and size of various on-chip memory
caches
. Performance is also affected by the number of streaming multiprocessors (SM) for NVidia GPUs, or compute units (CU) for AMD GPUs, or Xe cores for Intel Xe-based GPUs, which describe the number of on-silicon processor core units within the GPU chip that perform the core calculations, typically working in parallel with other SM/CUs on the GPU. GPU performance is typically measured in floating point operations per second (
FLOPS
); Modern GPUs typically deliver performance measured in teraflops (TFLOPS). This is an estimated performance measure, and should not be treated as fact, as other factors can affect actual performance.
[

Modern GPUs also include dedicated hardware blocks for
ray tracing
,
video encoding
, and
AI acceleration
.
GPU forms
[
edit
]
In personal computers, there are two main forms of GPUs: dedicated graphics (also called discrete graphics) and integrated graphics (also called shared graphics solutions, integrated graphics processors (IGP), or unified memory architecture (UMA).
[

Dedicated graphics processing unit
[

Video card
Dedicated graphics processing units
use on board
RAM
that is dedicated to the GPU rather than relying on the computer's main system memory. This RAM is usually specially selected for the expected serial workload of the graphics card, such as
GDDR SDRAM
. This has massive performance benefits, but the caveat of "choking" when running out of dedicated memory, worsening performance.
Technologies such as
Scalable Link Interface
(SLI),
NVLink
, and
CrossFire
allow multiple GPUs to draw images simultaneously for a single screen, increasing the processing power available for graphics. These technologies, however, are increasingly uncommon; most games do not fully use multiple GPUs, as most users cannot afford them.

The position of an integrated GPU in a
northbridge

system layout.
An
ASRock
motherboard with integrated graphics, which has HDMI, VGA and DVI-out ports.
Integrated graphics processing units
(IGPU), also called
integrated graphics
,
shared graphics solutions
,
integrated graphics processors
(IGP), or
unified memory architectures
(UMA) use a portion of a computer's system RAM rather than dedicated graphics memory. IGPs can be integrated onto a motherboard as part of its
northbridge
chipset,
[
13
]
or on the same
die (integrated circuit)
with the CPU, such as
Accelerated Processing Unit
(AMD APU) or
Intel HD Graphics
. IGPUs and APUs are less costly to implement than dedicated graphics processing, but tend to be less capable. Integrated graphics processing was considered unfit for 3D games or graphically intensive programs but could run less intensive programs such as Adobe Flash. Examples of such IGPs would be offerings from SiS and VIA circa 2004.
[
14
]
However, modern integrated graphics processors such as
AMD Accelerated Processing Units
and
Intel Graphics Technology
can even handle Triple A games at lower settings.
[
citation needed
]
Because GPU computations are memory-intensive, integrated processing may compete with the CPU for relatively slow system RAM, as it has minimal or no dedicated video memory. IGPUs use system memory with bandwidth up to a current maximum of 128 gigabytes per second, whereas a discrete graphics card may have a bandwidth
[
15
]
of more than 1000 gigabytes per second between its
video random access memory
(VRAM) and GPU core. This
memory bus
bandwidth can limit the performance of the IGPU, though
multi-channel memory
can mitigate this deficiency.

On systems with "Unified Memory Architecture" (UMA), including modern AMD processors with integrated graphics,
[

modern Intel processors with integrated graphics,
[

Apple processors, and modern consoles, the CPU cores and the GPU block share the same pool of RAM and memory address space.

Stream processing and general purpose GPUs (GPGPU)
[
edit
]
Main articles:
GPGPU
and
Stream processing
It is common to use a general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) as a modified form of stream processor or a
vector processor
, running
compute kernels
. This turns the massive computational power of a modern graphics accelerator's shader pipeline into general-purpose computing power. In certain applications requiring massive vector operations, this can yield several orders of magnitude higher performance than a conventional CPU. The two largest discrete GPU designers,
AMD
and
Nvidia
, are pursuing this approach with an array of applications.
[
as of?
]
Nvidia and AMD collaborated with
Stanford University
to create a GPU-based client for the
Folding@home
distributed computing project for protein folding calculations. In certain circumstances, the GPU calculates forty times faster than the CPUs traditionally used by such applications.
[

[

GPU-based high performance computers play a significant role in large-scale modelling. Three of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world take advantage of GPU acceleration.
[
21
]
[

]
Since 2005 there has been interest in using the performance offered by GPUs for
evolutionary computation
in general, and for accelerating the
fitness
evaluation in
genetic programming
in particular.
[
citation needed
]
Most approaches compile
linear
or
tree programs
on the host PC and transfer the executable to the GPU to be run. Typically a performance advantage is only obtained by running the single active program simultaneously on many example problems in parallel, using the GPU's
single instruction, multiple data
(SIMD) architecture.
[
22
]
[

Substantial acceleration can also be obtained by not compiling the programs, and instead transferring them to the GPU, to be interpreted there.
[
23
]
External GPU (eGPU)
[
edit
]
A GPU can be attached to some external bus of a notebook.
PCI Express
is the only bus used for this purpose.
[
as of?
]
The port may be, for example, an
ExpressCard
or
mPCIe
port (PCIe ×1, up to 5 or 2.5 gigabits per second respectively), a
Thunderbolt
1, 2, or 3 port (PCIe ×4, up to 10, 20, or 40 gigabits per second respectively), a
USB4 port with Thunderbolt compatibility
, or an
OCuLink
port. Those ports are only available on certain notebook systems.
[

eGPU enclosures include their own power supply (PSU), because powerful GPUs can consume hundreds of watts.

Adage Graphics terminal from 1968 brochure
Dedicated 3D graphics hardware dates back to graphic
terminals
such as the
Adage
AGT-30 from 1967 with
analog
matrix
processors. In 1969
Evans & Sutherland
(E&S) introduced the
Line Drawing System-1
(LDS-1), which was the first all-digital system to provide matrix multiplication. Also in 1969, the low-cost graphics terminal
IMLAC PDS-1
was introduced. It later saw use as an early 3D gaming machine with the likes of Maze War.
1970s
[

In professional hardware, in 1972
PLATO IV
system becomes operational at the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
. Between around 1973 and 1978, several networked multiplayer wireframe 3D games are implemented and popularized by users of the system. Also in 1972, the E&S Continuous Tone 1 (CT1) "Watkins box" system (consisting of an E&S LDS-2 and
Shaded Picture System
) is delivered to
Case Western Reserve University
. It offered the first real-time
Gouraud shading
. In 1975, a joint effort between Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation and the University of Utah's computer graphics department results in the first ever MOSFET video
framebuffer
, capable of color and smooth shading. E&S Continuous Tone 3 (CT3) system was delivered in 1977 to
Lufthansa
for pilot training using computer simulation. It was the first graphics system capable of real-time texture mapping.

Arcade system boards
have used specialized 2D graphics circuits since the 1970s. In early video game hardware,
RAM
for frame buffers was expensive, so video chips composited data together as the display was being scanned out on the monitor.
[

A specialized
barrel shifter
circuit helped the CPU animate the
framebuffer
graphics for various 1970s
arcade video games

Atari 8-bit computers
(1979) had
ANTIC
, a video processor which interpreted instructions describing a "

Geometry Engine integrated circuit
In the 1980s significant advancements were made in professional 3D graphics hardware. Perhaps most impactful was the 1981 development of the
Geometry Engine
, a
VLSI
vector
processor
ASIC
designed by
Jim Clark
and
Marc Hannah
at
Stanford University
. This processor is the forerunner of modern
tensor
cores and other similar processors marketed for graphics and AI. The Geometry Engine went on to be used in
Silicon Graphics
workstations
for many years. Silicon Graphics's first product, shipped in November 1983, was the IRIS 1000, a terminal with hardware-accelerated 3D graphics based on the Geometry Engine.
[

A
The 1981
NEC μPD7220
was the first implementation of a
personal computer
graphics display processor as a single
large-scale integration
(LSI)
integrated circuit
chip. This enabled the design of low-cost, high-performance video graphics cards such as those from
Number Nine Visual Technology
. It became the best-known GPU until the mid-1980s.
[
36

It was the first fully integrated
VLSI
(very large-scale integration)
metal–oxide–semiconductor
(
NMOS
) graphics display processor for PCs, supported up to
1024×1024 resolution
, and laid the foundations for the PC graphics market. It was used in a number of graphics cards and was licensed for clones such as the Intel 82720, the first of
Intel's graphics processing units
.

In 1984,
Hitachi
released the ARTC HD63484, the first major
CMOS
graphics processor for personal computers. The ARTC could display up to
4K resolution
when in
monochrome
mode. It was used in a number of graphics cards and terminals during the late 1980s.
[

MOS 8367R0 – Agnus
In 1985, the
Amiga
was released with a custom graphics chip called
Agnus
including a blitter for bitmap manipulation, line drawing, and area fill. It also included a
coprocessor
with its own simple instruction set, that was capable of manipulating graphics hardware registers in sync with the video beam (e.g. for per-scanline palette switches,
sprite multiplexing
, and hardware windowing), or driving the blitter.
[

Also in 1985, IBM released the
Professional Graphics Controller
, designed by later to be Nvidia co-founder
Curtis Priem
, which was a rudimentary 3D card with
640 × 480
256-color graphics which used a dedicated CPU to draw graphics independently of the main system. It was used as the basis of cards by a number of makers (including
Matrox
) and its analog RGB signaling led directly to the VGA video standard.
[

Priem later in the 80s worked on the influential
Sun Microsystems
GX (also known as cgsix) accelerated 2D graphics card.
[
41

In 1986,
Texas Instruments
released the
TMS34010
, the first fully programmable graphics processor.
[
42

It could run general-purpose code but also had a graphics-oriented instruction set. During 1990–1992, this chip became the basis of the
Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture
("TIGA")
Windows accelerator
cards.
The
IBM 8514
Micro Channel adapter, with memory add-on
Following in 1987, the
IBM 8514
graphics system was released. It was one of the first video cards for
IBM PC compatibles
that implemented
fixed-function
2D primitives in
electronic hardware
.
Sharp
's
X68000
, released in 1987, used a custom graphics chipset
[
43

with a 65,536 color palette and hardware support for sprites, scrolling, and multiple playfields.
[
44
]
It served as a development machine for
Capcom
's
CP System
arcade board. Fujitsu's
FM Towns
computer, released in 1989, had support for a 16,777,216 color palette.
[
45

For context,
IBM
also introduced its
Video Graphics Array
(VGA) display system in 1987, with a maximum resolution of
640 × 480
pixels. Unlike 8514/A, VGA had no hardware acceleration features. In November 1988,
NEC Home Electronics
announced its creation of the
Video Electronics Standards Association
(VESA) to develop and promote a
Super VGA
(SVGA)
computer display standard
as a successor to VGA. Super VGA enabled
graphics display resolutions
up to
800 × 600
pixels
, a 56% increase.

In 1988 SGI sold IRIS workstation graphics with 10-12 Geometry Engines and introduced the
IrisVision
add-in board for IBM MicroChannel bus (
RS/6000
) based on the Geometry Engine as well.
[

The 1990s again saw considerable advancements in professional workstation 3D graphics hardware from Sun Microsystems, SGI, and others. The introduction of
OpenGL
by SGI in 1992 paved the way for standard hardware-independent 3D programming interfaces.
[
49

However, by the mid and late 90s, professional hardware was being slowly eclipsed by consumer products which offered similar or even better performance, especially in regards to texture mapping, at a lower cost and on platforms familiar to end users.
[

[
51

In 1991,
S3 Graphics
introduced the
S3 86C911
, which its designers named after the
Porsche 911
as an indication of the performance increase it promised.
[
52

The 86C911 spawned a variety of imitators: by 1995, all major PC graphics chip makers had added
2D
acceleration support to their chips.
[
53

Fixed-function
Windows accelerators
surpassed expensive general-purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance, and such coprocessors faded from the PC market.
In the early- and mid-1990s,
real-time
3D graphics became increasingly common in arcade, computer, and console games, which led to increasing public demand for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. Early examples of mass-market 3D graphics hardware can be found in arcade system boards such as the
Sega Model 1
,
Namco System 22
, and
Sega Model 2
, and the
fifth-generation video game consoles
such as the
Saturn
,
PlayStation
, and
Nintendo 64
. Arcade systems such as the Sega Model 2 and
SGI
Onyx
-based Namco Magic Edge Hornet Simulator in 1993 were capable of hardware T&L (
transform, clipping, and lighting
) years before appearing in consumer graphics cards.
[

Another early example is the
Super FX
chip, a
RISC

on-cartridge graphics chip
used in some
SNES
games, notably
Doom

Star Fox
. Some systems used
DSPs
to accelerate transformations.
Fujitsu

In October 2002, with the introduction of the
ATI
Radeon 9700
(also known as R300), the world's first
Direct3D
9.0 accelerator, pixel and vertex
shaders
could implement
looping
and lengthy
floating point
math, and were quickly becoming as flexible as CPUs, yet orders of magnitude faster for image-array operations. Pixel shading is often used for
bump mapping
, which adds texture to make an object look shiny, dull, rough, or even round or extruded.
[

With the introduction of the Nvidia
GeForce 8 series
and new generic stream processing units, GPUs became more generalized computing devices.
Parallel
GPUs are making computational inroads against the CPU, and a subfield of research, dubbed GPU computing or

CUDA
,
OpenCL
,
DirectCompute
) and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader.

AI accelerator
In the 2020s, GPUs have been increasingly used for calculations involving
embarrassingly parallel
problems, such as training of
neural networks
on enormous datasets that are needed for artificial intelligence
large language models
. Specialized processing cores on most modern GPUs that are dedicated to
deep learning
provide significant
FLOPS
performance increases, using 4×4 matrix multiplication and division. Early implementations, such as Nvidia's
Volta
microarchitecture, released in 2017,
[
90
]
saw results of up to 128 TFLOPS in some applications.
[
91
]
Since then, AI acceleration cores have been a widely adopted feature in consumer and workstation microarchitectures starting with Nvidia's
Turing
microarchitecture in 2018,
[
80
]
named Tensor cores. Originally used for
Deep Learning Super Sampling
(DLSS) to enhance gaming performance and improve image quality, they have since been used in Nvidia's
Broadcast
software to provide many AI powered effects such as voice filtering and video noise removal and in other software such as
Blender
for DLSS in the view port.
AMD originally implemented their equivalent "Matrix" Cores for consumers in their
RDNA 3
architecture - however RDNA 4's Matrix Cores were the first to introduce FP8 acceleration - which is required to run the full
FSR Redstone
feature set such as Machine Learning Upscaling and Frame Generation. However, community made hacks on both Linux and Windows have allowed RDNA 2, 3, and competitor GPUs to run a weaker version of FSR 4 known as FSR 4 INT8. The
PlayStation 5 Pro
, launched in 2024, has customized Machine Learning cores - which focus solely on INT8 acceleration - based on RDNA 4's for PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution to enhance framerates and image quality.
Intel has implemented their equivalent "XMX" Cores in all of their
Arc
GPUs, starting with the
Alchemist
microarchitecture. This is used for XeSS (Xe Super Sampling), XeFG (Xe Frame Generation), and more.
Ray tracing has also been incredibly prevalent in the 2020s with some games, such as
DOOM: The Dark Ages
, requiring a hardware ray tracing capable GPU to even start
[
92
]
. While it does lead to worse performance and less overall accessibility,
id software
claimed this saved several man hours and shrinked the game by over 100 gigabytes due to the game being entirely built around ray tracing

In 2013, 438.3 million GPUs were shipped globally and the forecast for 2014 was 414.2 million.However, by the third quarter of 2022, shipments of PC GPUs totaled around 75.5 million units, down 19% year-over-year.
